# Limitations

## Image limitations

Current version supports human-like characters. For now Chatalk cannot handle faces that are too abstract (monsters, deformed caricatures, anime-style characters, etc.)

* Supported character styles: Images that can extract landmarks such as human eyes, nose, mouth, etc.
* **Unsupported** character styles: Images of machines, monsters, anime-style characters, etc.


**Examples**

Supported character styles:
