## Open wizard window

![Open scene](/_static/images/Support/DialogueSystemforUnity/dialogue_system_for_unity_install_pre.png "Open scene")

Before you start, open the demo Scene of the Dialogue System in `Assets/Plugins/Pixel Crushers/Dialogue System/Demo/Scenes/DemoScene1.unity`

<br>


![Wizard Path](/_static/images/Support/DialogueSystemforUnity/dialogue_system_for_unity_wizard_01.png "Wizard Path")

Open Dialogue System for Unity Wizard from `Window -> Murple -> Chatalk -> Support -> Dialogue System for Unity`
<br>

### Initialize step

![Wizard Chatalk Database](/_static/images/Support/DialogueSystemforUnity/dialogue_system_for_unity_wizard_02.png "Wizard Chatalk Database")

If this is first time to use Chatalk, or database asset of Chatalk is missing, you should make Chatalk database asset.
Make database asset to click ``Create Database`` button. If there is already database, please select your database.

<br>

![Wizard DialogueSystem Page](/_static/images/Support/DialogueSystemforUnity/dialogue_system_for_unity_wizard_03.png "Wizard DialogueSystem Page")

Select `Controller` GameObject and `Database` Asset of  Dialogue System to apply Chatalk.
If you select vaild GameObject and Asset, you can proceed to next step.

This tutorial uses the **DemoScene**\(**DemoScene1.unity**\) from the Dialogue System for Unity. Please select `Controller` and `Database` used in the demo scene.

<br>

### Actor step

![Wizard Actor Page](/_static/images/Support/DialogueSystemforUnity/dialogue_system_for_unity_wizard_04.png "Wizard Actor Page")

Select `Actor` who want to make him/her/its *talking* using Chatalk.
For this tutorial, select **Private Hart**. In the tutorial, we change the Sprite to apply Chatalk.

If you select vaild `Actor` (has valid sprite or texture that describe actor's appearance), you can proceed to next step.

<br>

### Constraints

The Sprite used in Actor must meet the following constraints.

 - Asset: Texture type should be `Sprite (2D and UI)`.
 - Image size: The length of one side cannot exceed 2048.
 - Image style: [Image limitations](/Limitations/image_limitations.md)

<br>

### Conversation step

![Wizard Conversation Page](/_static/images/Support/DialogueSystemforUnity/dialogue_system_for_unity_wizard_05.png "Wizard Conversation Page")

A list of `Conversations` that `Actor` involved will appear at left. Becuase Chatalk makes talking animation using audio, you can select only `Conversation` that contains audio file.
If you select `Conversations` that has audio files, you can proceed to generation step.

<br>

### API Key

![Wizard API Key Setting](/_static/images/Support/DialogueSystemforUnity/dialogue_system_for_unity_wizard_06.png "Wizard API Key Setting")

### Apply Step

![Wizard Apply Page](/_static/images/Support/DialogueSystemforUnity/dialogue_system_for_unity_wizard_10.png "Wizard Apply Page")


When you enter the Apply Page, all mp4 files of the task are downloaded.
You need to select `UI Prefab` to apply Chatalk video player.
The prefab must contain `Standard Dialogue UI components` and `Portrait Image`.

If all mp4 files are downloaded and you select valid `UI Prefab`, the message ``Ready.`` will appear and you can apply it by clicking the `Apply` button.

In the tutorial, `Wheel Standard Dialogue UI Prefab` used in `DemoScene1.unity` was used.

## Result

![Applied Scene](/_static/images/Support/DialogueSystemforUnity/dialogue_system_for_unity_wizard_12.gif "Applied Scene")

This is the play capture using Chatalk animation.
In order to view the Chatalk animation larger, we adjusted the size and position of the **Portrait Image UI** in **DemoScene1.unity**.
